<div class="contents dropcap"><p>Look at the song title &quot;I Am a God&quot; and it seems like easy blasphemy-- <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"><span>Kanye West</span></a>&apos;s update of John Lennon&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_popular_than_Jesus"><span>&quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;</span></a> shocker from 1966. But just as the Beatle&apos;s proclamation was fuller and wiser in context-- &quot;I believe that what people call God is something in all of us,&quot; Lennon would later explain-- &quot;I Am a God&quot; is not simply the latest self-important blast from one of pop culture&apos;s pre-eminent egoists. For starters, the track sounds less triumphant than breathtakingly vexed, crashing in with a gnarled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DNHAQJzUWH0">dancehall vocal sample</a> and paranoid sawtooth synths that aim to destroy. Here, Kanye raps about loyalty, respect, threesomes, and, yes, <a href="http://pitchfork.tumblr.com/post/53219216121#notes">croissants</a> with the urgency of someone being chased by a 30-ton steamroller. The song is pierced by a series of primal screams, pixelated outbursts that are only briefly able to halt the beat&apos;s heaving evil. In Kanye&apos;s hands, being a god sounds stressful as hell, something we can all relate to, and the song&apos;s <span><a href="https://twitter.com/malikyusef/statuses/316387475499143168">apparent inspiration</a>&#xA0;is</span>&#xA0;a passage from the book of Psalms: &quot;I have said, <a href="http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-82-6/"><span>Ye are gods</span></a>; and all of you are children of the most High.&quot;</p> <p>These are the immeasurably lofty stakes Kanye deals in on <i>Yeezus</i>, his sixth solo album. His intensity here has a heightened desperation as he howls into the void, but the Chicago native has always been beguiled by the view from above. Take &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g">Jesus Walks</a>&quot;, where he references another Psalm while gasping from on high: &quot;I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is/ Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless.&quot; Then, on &quot;POWER&quot;, he contemplates leaping out of the penthouse, &quot;letting everything go.&quot; In a way, <i>Yeezus</i> is the panicked sound of that ensuing&#xA0;free-fall, a rush of angst and despair with absolutely nothing left to lose.&#xA0;</p> <p>The album&#xA0;is something of a razor-sharpened take on 2008&apos;s distressed <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i> and marks a blunt break with the filigreed maximalism Kanye so thoroughly nailed on <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></i>. In hindsight, the latter record-- with its ingratiating GOOD Fridays buildup, endless guest list, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMxHfmXKVU">uncharacteristically apologetic interview sessions</a>-- was his attempt at recapturing a superstar-sized American audience after a slew of entertaining-yet-questionable PR <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/14/obama-kanye-is-a-jackass_n_286623.html">incidents</a>. Except it didn&apos;t exactly work: While <i>Twisted Fantasy</i> was universally lauded and went platinum, it still stands as Kanye&apos;s worst-selling album to date, failing to produce a top 10 single.&#xA0;But even if it wasn&apos;t a chart smash, the intricacy and durability of <i>Twisted Fantasy</i> incubated the Cult of Kanye to an extreme level. &quot;I&#x2019;d rather piss a bunch of people off and make myself happy than make everyone else happy and be pissed off inside,&quot; he told <i><a href="http://splitinfinitives.com/post/52947639353/i-really-believe-in-absolute-truth-a-nearly">VIBE</a></i> around the release of <i>808s</i>. <i>Yeezus</i> doubles-down on this exclusionary philosophy: &quot;Soon as they like you, make &apos;em unlike you/ &apos;Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you.&quot;</p> <p>For Kanye, there&apos;s purpose in repulsion. And on <i>Yeezus</i>, he trades out smooth soul and anthemic choruses for jarring electro, acid house, and industrial grind while delivering some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales yet. This is willful provocation that <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/">Ice Cube</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/">Madonna</a>, and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/">Trent Reznor</a> could all be proud of. Some of the record has him tackling the same issues he&apos;s been rapping about since <i>The College Dropout</i>, albeit with a fire-eyed stare. On his debut&apos;s &quot;Family Business&quot;, he poignantly lamented a jailed cousin&apos;s absence at the Thanksgiving dinner table in a manner &quot;so sweet, like a photo of your granny&apos;s picture.&quot; On <i>Yeezus</i>, he&apos;s still addressing the plight of incarcerated black men, but now he&apos;s incensed. With &quot;New Slaves&quot;, he confronts us with vulgar stereotypes while exposing the prison-industrial complex for the deeply systemic racist sham that it is.</p> <p>Meanwhile, XXX creeper &quot;I&apos;m In It&quot; sounds like a dancehall orgasm mired in quicksand and makes previous come-ons like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrMrqBcv6Mk">&quot;Slow Jamz&quot;</a> come off like Disney theme songs. &quot;The kids and the wife life, but can&apos;t wake up from the nightlife,&quot; says the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/06/15/it-girl-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-welcome-new-baby/">new father</a> on that track&apos;s knowingly button-pushing final verse. &quot;I&apos;m so scared of my demons/ I go to sleep with a nightlight.&quot; Kanye told <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/music/kanye-west-talks-about-his-career-and-album-yeezus.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">The New York Times</a></i> he&apos;s recently reached a new level of Zen, but this is the opposite of beach-chair music. Perhaps the album&apos;s most explicit lines are the blurry fantasies of a confessed <a href="http://realtalkny.uproxx.com/2007/04/topic/topic/news/kanye-west-a-porn-addict-since-being-young/">porn addict</a> who&apos;s described his daughter&apos;s mother as a &quot;superstar all from a home movie.&quot; Without much room for levity,&#xA0;Kanye&apos;s complicated and distrustful view of women is unrelenting on <i>Yeezus</i>. And while there&apos;s no real excuse for flat oafishness like &quot;eatin&apos; Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce,&quot; many of the album&apos;s most powerful moments have him broken down, insecure, and bloody, railing against an ineptitude with the opposite sex.</p> <p>Album pinnacle &quot;Blood on the Leaves&quot; tells a nightmarish story of divorce and betrayal, all while samples of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/">Nina Simone</a>&apos;s pitched-up &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/">TNGHT</a>&apos;s demonic &quot;R U Ready&quot; horns play yin and yang to the&#xA0;protagonist&apos;s&#xA0;alternately sorrowful and furious headspace. &quot;Hold My Liquor&quot; and &quot;Guilt Trip&quot;, meanwhile, find Kanye trying to restate his manhood while his emotions crumble around him; if he&apos;s not drunk and swerve-y, trying vainly to reconcile with an ex, he&apos;s hoping to brag himself out of being dumped. Caustic humor shows up now and then, buoying certain lines or tracks like &quot;Send It Up&quot; and &quot;Bound 2&quot;, but it&apos;s often fleeting. As on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek">&quot;Runaway&quot;</a>, there&apos;s something palpably sad about the men in these songs, which twists them away from misogynistic assertions of power toward feelings that are ultimately more self-destructive. As contemporaries like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/">Jay-Z</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/">Beyonc&#xE9;</a>, and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/">Justin Timberlake</a> increasingly devote their music to largely winning tales of contentment, Kanye is unwilling or unable to settle for settling down.</p> <p>This discomfort is essential to his enduring appeal. For instance, instead of working with giant phone companies to guarantee commercial success, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/51187-jay-z-announces-new-lp-magna-carta-holy-grail/">a la his big brother</a>, Kanye&apos;s now making a point out of rejecting corporate sponsorship. Whether it&apos;s a meaningful stance or a blindly contrarian move is up for debate. But after&#xA0;<a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50312-rick-ross-issues-formal-apology-for-controversial-ueono-verse/">recent</a> <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50600-lil-wayne-dropped-from-mountain-dew-over-emmitt-till-controvery-till-family-responds/">tensions</a> <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50587-tyler-the-creator-defends-mountain-dew-ad/">between</a>&#xA0;<span>hip-hop and corporate America, visceral and disturbing lines like &quot;put my fist in her like a civil rights sign&quot; put Kanye beyond the reach of mainstream brands hoping to siphon his credibility.</span>&#xA0;As he told the <i>Times</i>, he&apos;s not disinterested in the idea of big companies or big money-- he compared himself to Steve Jobs, after all-- but he wants control.&#xA0;</p> <p>The restlessness spreads to his aesthetic and collaborative choices. Rather than relying on known hitmakers to augment his music, Kanye solicited ideas from exciting up-and-comers including <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/">Hudson Mohawke</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30552-young-chop/">Young Chop</a>, and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/">Arca</a>. And even veteran producers involved in the project, like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6945-rick-rubin/">Rick Rubin</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/">Daft Punk</a>, were seemingly chosen not for their name recognition but their history of rule-breaking. In the mid-1980s, Rubin veered away from the colorful, party-starting tones of early rap music and created bare, hard beats for LL Cool J, Run-D.M.C., and the Beastie Boys-- a perfect fit for <i>Yeezus</i>&apos; less-is-more snarl. And though Kanye&apos;s blaring, digitized assault couldn&apos;t be further from Daft Punk&apos;s naturalistic, groove-based <i>Random Access Memories</i>, the artists share a basic philosophy. As Daft Punk&apos;s Thomas Bangalter recently <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/">said</a> of their new record: &quot;We had the luxury to do things that so many people cannot do, but it doesn&apos;t mean that with luxury comes comfort.&quot;</p> <p>The idea extends to the how <i>Yeezus</i> treats the human voice. Running with the confounding hook from last year&apos;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dqgr0wNyPo">&quot;Mercy&quot;</a>, dancehall patois is scattered throughout, bringing with it that music&apos;s sense of menacing confrontation. And <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/">Bon Iver</a>&apos;s Justin Vernon shows up on a few tracks, using his voice to give the darkness an angelic tint. Expanding upon the cracked vocal experimentation on <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>&apos;s &quot;Blame Game&quot;, Kanye&apos;s own voice is often shadowed by pitched-down ghouls. And though he could&apos;ve likely chosen any rapper on earth to guest on the riotous &quot;Send It Up&quot;-- probably the most likely, if not only, chance <i>Yeezus&#xA0;</i>has for a rap-radio hit-- he chose Chicago&apos;s relatively unknown <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30608-king-l/">King L</a>. His presence, along with that of fellow Chi-town driller <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/">Chief Keef</a>, makes the message clear: America may want to ignore these young black men from the gang-strewn South Side, but here, they have a voice.</p> <p>All of these unlikely choices demonstrate how cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on&#xA0;<i>Yeezus</i>, perhaps more than any other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the record&apos;s fast 40 minutes. The precise approach runs through <i>Yeezus</i>&apos; guerrilla-style promotion, too, which found an army of dark vans lighting projections onto buildings around the world, itself a boots-on-the-ground reaction to today&apos;s InstaTweet brand of music dissemination. I went to one of these impromptu happenings last Saturday night, in the middle of Manhattan. At 1:20 a.m., the words &quot;NOT FOR SALE&quot; lit up on the south side of the Louis Vuitton building. A few guys ran across the street with Christmas-morning glee, snapping photos. Then, Kanye&apos;s starkly-lit visage appeared to recite &quot;New Slaves&quot;&apos;s anti-consumerist lines as cabs streaked by the luxury stores below. His was the only black face to be seen across the jumbo ads lining an eerily desolate&#xA0;5th Ave. The van soon closed its doors and drove away; the culture bomb&#x2019;s flash was over in an instant, but the reverberations were just starting to spread.</p></div>
